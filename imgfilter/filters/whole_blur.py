"""
Filter for detecting blurred images.

Four focus measure algorithms that are described in "Analysis of focus
measure operators for shape-from-focus" (Pattern recognition, 2012) by
Pertuz et al are applied to the whole image. Focus measures measure
the relative degree of focus of an image, and the implementations are
based on their respective MATLAB implementations.

The image is also divided into 5x5 equal-sized rectangles, and the
focus measures are applied to these parts as well. As described by
Mavridaki et al. in their paper "No-reference blur assessment in
natural images using Fourier transform and spatial pyramids" (IEEE
Int. Conf. on Image Processing (ICIP 2014), 2004), this is done to
avoid the possibility of images having non-blurred parts misleading
the focus measures.

The outcomes of the focus measure algorithms for the whole image and
the smaller parts are concatenated into an input vector for a support
vector machine used for the prediction. By default, the SVM has been
trained with the CERTH Image Blur Dataset. The final prediction is
weighed by analyzing the probability of motion blur from the imageâ€™s
exif data, if possible.
